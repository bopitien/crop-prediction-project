# crop-prediction-project

Measuring essential soil metrics such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium levels, and pH value is an important aspect of assessing soil condition. However, it can be an expensive and time-consuming process, which can cause farmers to prioritize which metrics to measure based on their budget constraints.

Farmers have various options when it comes to deciding which crop to plant each season. Their primary objective is to maximize the yield of their crops, taking into account different factors. One crucial factor that affects crop growth is the condition of the soil in the field, which can be assessed by measuring basic elements such as nitrogen and potassium levels. Each crop has an ideal soil condition that ensures optimal growth and maximum yield.

A farmer reached out, as a machine learning expert for assistance in selecting the best crop for his field. They've provided a dataset called soil_measures.csv, which contains:

"N": Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
"P": Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
"K": Potassium content ratio in the soil
"pH" value of the soil
"crop": categorical values that contain various crops (target variable).
Each row in this dataset represents various measures of the soil in a particular field. Based on these measurements, the crop specified in the "crop" column is the optimal choice for that field.

## The task in this project involves two main objectives:

* Predict the Crop Type: Use the variables N (Nitrogen),P (Phosphorous), K (Potassium), and pH value of the soil to build a machine learning model that can predict the type of crop (categorical target variable) that would be best suited for a given set of soil conditions. This is a classic example of a multi-class classification problem.

* Identify the Most Significant Variable: Apart from predicting the crop type, a key part of the project is to determine which of these soil metrics (N, P, K, or pH) is the most predictive of the crop type. This involves analyzing the feature importance from the model to see which variable contributes the most to the model's predictive performance. This helps in understanding which soil metric is most critical for deciding the crop type, which can be very valuable for optimizing the use of resources in agricultural practices.
